## User story

- [x] **User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements. 

- [x] **User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page 
(e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug"). 

- [x] **User Story #3:** I should see a div element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`. 

- [x] **User Story #4:** Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding `id="image"`.

- [x] **User Story #5:** Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
 
- [x] **User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- [x] **User Story #7:** I should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about 
the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab 
(i.e. target="_blank").

- [x] **User Story #8:** The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- [x] **User Story #9:** The img element should be centered within its parent element.
